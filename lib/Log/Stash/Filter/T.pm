=head1 NAME

Log::Stash::Filter::T - Send a message stream to multiple outputs.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This filter is used to duplicate a message stream to two or more outputs.

All messages are duplicated to all output streams, so you may want to follow
this with L<Log::Stash::Filter::Key> to one or more of those streams.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 output_to

Just like a normal L<Log::Stash::Role::Input> class, except takes an array of outputs.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 consume

Sends the consumed message to all output_to instances.
